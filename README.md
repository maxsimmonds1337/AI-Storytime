# AI-Storytime

## todo
[] user profile, so don't have to ask about the child each time
[] use the user profile to make images of the same person for each image, maybe seed the image to help
[] host on gcp some how
[] allow people to slightly edit the same story, this would mean having to pass the same story back I guess
